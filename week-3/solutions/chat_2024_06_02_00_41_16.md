This code is for a login endpoint for admin users. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The `generateJwt` function takes a `user` object and generates a JSON Web Token (JWT) for that user. It creates a payload containing the user's username and signs it with a secret key, setting an expiration time of 1 hour for the token.

2. When a POST request is made to the "/admin/login" endpoint, the username and password are extracted from the request headers.

3. The code then checks if there's an admin user in the `ADMINS` array that matches the provided username and password. If a matching admin user is found, the `generateJwt` function is called with the admin user as an argument to generate a token.

4. If the admin user is authenticated (i.e., matching username and password are found), a token is generated and sent back in the response along with a message indicating successful login.

5. If no matching admin user is found, a 403 Forbidden status is returned with a message indicating that admin authentication failed.

Now, addressing the concern about verifying admin authentication without checking the password directly in this code:

The code does verify the admin user's authentication by checking the username and password against the `ADMINS` array. However, it's important to note that in a real-world application, it's not safe to send passwords in headers. The usual practice is to use a secure method, such as sending the username and password in the request body over HTTPS, to securely authenticate users. In this case, the example code assumes that the authentication process has already taken place and verified the admin user's credentials before reaching the login endpoint.

In a real-world scenario, the password should not be sent in headers, and it should be securely hashed and stored in a database. When a user attempts to log in, the hashed password should be retrieved and compared to the hashed version of the password provided by the user. If the hashes match, the user is considered authenticated.

So, while the code in the example may not showcase the full and secure authentication process, it is used here to demonstrate the generation of a JWT after successful authentication and the subsequent use of the token for authorization in future requests.
